
How to build LibTorrent under Visual Studio 2005.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. First of all, you need the boost library installed.
Download boost from www.boost.org and follow the included instructions on how
to build it (you need to build boost in order to create the library files which
are used by libtorrent).

Let's say that you have the boost include/library files under 
C:\SDK\Boost

2. Open Visual Studio 2005 and go to Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions, 
select Include Files in the "Show Directories for" combo and add the boost include
path there (eg. C:\SDK\Boost\include).

3. Now select Library Files in the "Show Directories for" combo and add the boost library
path there (eg: C:\SDK\Boost\Lib).

3. Get asio. You can get it form http://asio.sourceforge.net/. 
You don't need to build it, just copy the asio folder
into libtorrent's include directory. Here's how it should look like:
C:\libtorrent\include\asio

Now you are ready to build libtorrent.

4. Open the LibTorrent2005 project file and hit F7 to build it.

5. If the build has gone well, you will find the .lib file in the Debug or Release
folders. The debug version of the libtorrent library is called LibTorrentD.lib and the 
release version is LibTorrent.lib


How to use LibTorrent in your app 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. First of all, open the Examples (client_test) project, build it and study it.
It demos all of the basic functionality of the libtorrent library.

2. To include libtorrent in your app, do the following:
add the libtorrent include path to your projects's additional include directories (in the C/C++\General section).
You must add both libtorrent\include and libtorrent\include\libtorrent direcotries.

3. Add the the libtorrent.lib library to your porject's additional dependencies (in the Linker\Input section).
Alternatively, you may want to link from the precompiled file. Here is a sample stdafx.h file:

//stdafx.h

#pragma once

#ifndef STRICT
#define STRICT
#endif

#define _WINVER 0x0500
#define _WIN32_WINDOWS 0x0500
#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0500
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN


#ifdef _DEBUG
	#pragma comment(lib, "TorrentLibD.lib")
#else
	#pragma comment(lib, "TorrentLib.lib")
#endif

#include <asio/detail/socket_types.hpp>
#include <windows.h>
...


Note that <asio/detail/socket_types.hpp> must be included before any other windows include file, otherwise you'll get
collisions with winsock.


4. Now you're ready to use LibTorrent !
